  "description": "This measure adds control logic to the model to reduce the peak electrical power draw (demand) from the utility. Demand is managed in this model by turning down the lights and equipment and increasing the cooling setpoints throughout the facility.",
  "modeler_description": "The measure will create demand limiting objects that attempt to control electric equipment to the user-input target demand limit. The demand limiting control will attempt to limit facility demand to the target during the SCE TOU peak demand period defined in the SCE tariffs. Demand will be limited in priority order of exterior lights, interior lights, interior electric equipment, and HVAC thermostats. User will input the maximum limit fractions for each of the electric loads, and reset temperatures for the thermostats, which will be applied to all such loads and zones in the model.",
